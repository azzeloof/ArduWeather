# ArduWeather
An Arduino-powered weather station with a web interface!

As written, this requires an Arduino and a seperate web server to hosst the interface. It's possible to combine the two and have the Arduino host everything, since it is already hosting a simple website. However, having the web interface hosted on a seperate UNIX server allows for easier editing and has been better for development.
